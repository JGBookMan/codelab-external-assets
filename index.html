        <p> Every year millions of Americans cause damage to their skeleton
          by not getting enough calcium (maybe,) A lot of this damage is
          (probably) preventable by simply ingesting more calcium. Keep your bones
          strong with a a helthy supply of milk. If you don't, your skeleton may
          decide to take its revenge... But for real osteoporosis is no laughing
          matter and can be quite the debilitating disease. Get your calcium
          now, before it's too late.
