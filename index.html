        <p> Every uear millions of Americans cause damage to their skeleton
          by not getting enough calcium (maybe,) A lot of this damage is
          (probably) preventable by simply ingesting more calcium. Keep your bones
          strong with a a helthy supply of milk. If you don't, your skeleton may
          decide to take its revenge...
